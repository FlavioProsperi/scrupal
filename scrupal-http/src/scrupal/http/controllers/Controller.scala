/** Abstract Controller
  *
  * A controller in scrupal is a route provider and action generator. It provides a route object which
  * should separate valid from invalid routes and generate Actions for the valid ones.
  *
  * Created by reidspencer on 10/29/14.

    * Scrupal's own controllers work within a -100 to 100 range and it is recommended that other
    * controllers operate within that same range. Note that this just helps optimize the processing
    * of routes.
