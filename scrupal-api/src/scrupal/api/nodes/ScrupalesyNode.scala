/** Generate Content With Scrupalesy
  *
  * This gets to be fun. Scrupaleasy is a Scala DSL designed to be a very simple language to help generate some content
  * Unlike the SubstitutionNode, this is not a template but an actual program to generate content. Scrupaleasy should be
  * dead simple: designed for non-programmers. For compatibility with SubstitutionNode it can access any of the same
  * values
  * with @{...} syntax but these can then be processed as UTF-8 characters, e.g. such as filtering. Setting up a Unix
  * like piepeline should be its top construction, essentially { block1 } | { block2 } would compute output from
  * block1 which is given as input to block2 which then yields the result. All Scrupaleasy scripts are either consumers,
  * producers or filters. Consumers eat input but produce no output. Instead they can "throw" an error. Consumers are
  * used to stop content from happening. They usually come at the end of a pipe to validate content. Producers ignore
  * their input but produce output. They are usually the first thing in a pipeline. Filters read their input and
  * convert it to some output. They are usually in the middle of a pipeline. You can compose a processing pipeline like
  * this by invoking a Scrupaleasy thing from another. The DSL should provide:
  *
  * - Basic if/else and select-from-options logic flow
  *
  * - Functions to manipulate streams of characters (e.g. length, regex match, substring, beginsWith, etc.)
  *
  * - The infamous munge function for text editing of Mac lore
  *
  * - Insertions with a SubstitutionNode element: `@{foo(...)}`
  *
  * - Require statements: like Scala require and throws an exception to stop pipeline processing
  *
  * - A lot of fun and joy for Scrupal authors :)
