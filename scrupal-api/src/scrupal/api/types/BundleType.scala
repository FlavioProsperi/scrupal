/** A group of named and typed fields that are related in some way.
  * An bundle type defines the structure of the fundamental unit of storage in Scrupal: An instance.  BundleTypes
  * are analogous to table definitions in relational databases, but with one important difference. An BundleType can
  * define itself recursively. That is, one of the fields of an Bundle can be another Bundle Type. Cycles in the
  * definitions of BundleTypes are not permitted. In this way it is possible to assemble entities from a large
  * collection of smaller bundle concepts (traits if you will). Like relational tables, bundle types define the names
  * and types of a group of fields (columns) that are in some way related. For example, a street name, city name,
  * country and postal code are fields of an address bundle because they are related by the common purpose of
  * specifying a location.
  *
  * Note that BundleTypes, along with ListType, SetType and MapType make the type system fully composable. You
  * can create an arbitrarily complex data structure (not that we recommend that you do so).
  *
  * @param id The name of the trait
  * @param description A description of the trait in terms of its purpose or utility
  * @param fields A map of the field name symbols to their Type
