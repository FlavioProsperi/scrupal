/** Simple Reverse Routing For Scrupal.
  *
  * Reverse Routing is the process of generating a URI path for a certain resource. In Scrupal, paths are not arbitrary
  * but highly structured and regular. Because of this regularity, the corresponding path can be constructed quite
  * easily especially from a given context. Every operation in Scrupal has a context in which that operation occurs.
  * The context provides the site, application, request context, and other details of the operation that is
  * requesting a path. Because the context is present, the path can be generated easily by simply substituting context
  * and requested elements. Some level of validation can occur too.
  *
