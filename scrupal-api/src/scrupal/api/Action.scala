    * encoded into the disposition as a simple enumeration value. This allows the receiver of the Result[P] to

  * Actions bring extensible behavior to Scrupal. An action object should be considered as a request to perform some

  *
  * - is a function that takes no arguments and returns a generic result (Result[_])
  *
  * - has a context that provides the invocation circumstances of the action
  *
  * - can be extended to include other information or behavior peculiar to a given type of action
  *
  * Action objects are how Scrupal represents an action taken from an external application. Actions are processed by
  * the ActionProcessor actor. Extensions of Action represent actual requests by adding parametric data to the Action
  * and implementing the `apply` function.
