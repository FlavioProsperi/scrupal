/** An Invokable Action
  *
  * Actions bring extensible behavior to Scrupal. An action object should be considered as a request to perform some
  * action in some context. To that end, you will note that an Action:
  *
  * - is a function that takes no arguments and returns a generic result (Result[_])
  *
  * - has a context that provides the invocation circumstances of the action
  *
  * - can be extended to include other information or behavior peculiar to a given type of action
  *
  * Action objects are how Scrupal represents an action taken from an external application. Actions are processed by
  * the ActionProcessor actor. Extensions of Action represent actual requests by adding parametric data to the Action
  * and implementing the `apply` function.

  */

  /** The action part of an Action object.
    *
    * Objects mixing in this trait will define apply to implement the Action. Note that the result type is a generic
    * Result[_]. The only things you have to return are a Disposition, a ContentType and some sort of payload of
    * arbitrary type. Clients of the action should understand the actual type of result.
    * @return The Result[_] yielded from executing the action.
