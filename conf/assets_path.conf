  # The sole function of this file is to retain the asset's path configuration for the ClassLoader.
  # Scrupal can be configured to look in other directories for assets to serve. This file contains that
  # configuration. It must remain in a separate file as Scrupal can overwrite it if the admin changes
  # the configuration through the web interface. The default here is for development work, none of which
  # will exist in a production environment.
