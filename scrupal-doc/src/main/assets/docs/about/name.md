# About The Name
You might be wondering about how we came up with Scrupal's name. It had a number of incarnations over a few years but
eventually the idea for Scrupal was: *do what Drupal did 15 years ago but make it much better*. We combined the
following elements:

* SCalable: Our goal is to far exceed Drupal's scalability and we use Scala as the primary programming language
* Reactive: Our goal is to support the [reactive manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/).
* drUPAL: Our goal is to be a best of breed modular content management system

So, I'm sure you've caught on by now: ```SCRUPAL = SCalable + Reactive + drUPAL```. We also like
that it has a pun with the word scruple since we profess a disciplined, scrupulous approach to software development.
Also, for humility's sake, the
[Urban Dictionary defines the word](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scrupal&defid=1265651) this way:
> *A small bit of any material or object*

And, no, sorry to disappoint, but this has nothing to do with screwing your pals!

Scrupal's name is also a mnemonic for its goals. Scrupal aims to be the foundation of the next generation of web
applications with the following goals:

- Scalable - Scrupal uses a [reactive](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) platform as the basis of a scalable framework that runs on the JVM.

- Comprehensive - Through a modular approach to extensibility Scrupal will readily extend itself

- Reactive - Scrupal supports the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) by focusing on events, scale, resiliency, and responsiveness.

- Uniform - Scrupal's uniform design at the right level of abstraction make large scale applications understandable without sacrificing customization or extensibility.

- Productive - Scrupal aims to be a highly productive tool for developers, users and operators of web systems because it applies [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) throughout.

- Application - Scrupal is application-oriented-software. It is not suited for systems programming but very adept at enterprise, mobile, and large scale web applications.

- Layer - Scrupal is a software layer that hides the complexities of integrating a suite of other technologies:

Scrupal has scruples. It is built on a set of principles honed from decades of software development experience.
