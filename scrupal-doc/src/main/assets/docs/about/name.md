# About The Name
You might be wondering about how we came up with Scrupal's name. It had a number of incarnations over a few years but
eventually the idea for Scrupal was: *do what Drupal did 15 years ago but make it much better*. We combined the 
following elements: 

* SCalable: Our goal is to far exceed Drupal's scalability and we use Scala as the primary programming language
* Reactive: Our goal is to support the [reactive manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/).
* drUPAL: Our goal is to be a best of breed modular content management system

So, I'm sure you've caught on by now: ```SCRUPAL = SCalable + Reactive + drUPAL```. We also like 
that it has a pun with the word scruple since we profess a disciplined, scrupulous approach to software development.
Also, for humility's sake, the 
[Urban Dictionary defines the word](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=scrupal&defid=1265651) this way:
> *A small bit of any material or object*

And, no, sorry to disappoint, but this has nothing to do with screwing your pals!
