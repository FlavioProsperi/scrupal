# About The Name
You might be wondering about how we came up with Scrupal's name. It had a number of incarnations over a few years but
eventually the idea for Scrupal was: *do what drupal did 15 years ago but make it much better*. The *make it much
better* part has a lot to do with the Scala programming language's emphasis on scalability which is also the key
emphasis in Scrupal. So, I'm sure you've caught on by now: ```SCRUPAL = SCalaable + dRUPAL```. We also like that it
has a pun with the word scruple. We profess a disciplined, scrupulous approach to software development. 

And, no, sorry to disappoint, but this has nothing to do with screwing your pals!
