# Ables
The `scrupal/api/Ables.scala` file is so named because the names of everything it defines end in "able". These are
the essential traits that are mixed in to various classes, and together, to add various combinations of simple data
elements. The primary things to know about this are:

- Identifiable takes a type parameter which provides the type by which the thing is identified. We use two basic
kinds: NumericIdentifier (Long) and SymbolicIdentifier (Symbol). Both of these can be used as primary keys in the
database. We use NumericIdentifier for things that have no memory cache (e.g. Instances) and we use
SymbolicIdentifier for things that have a memory cache (e.g. Modules and Types).
- There are really just a few essential traits: Creatable (has a creation timestamp), Modifiable (has a modification
time stamp), Nameable (has a name in addition to its identifier), Describable (has a description field). All the
  remaining traits are just combinations of these essential ones.
