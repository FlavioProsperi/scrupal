## Scrupal Features

### Simple Installation
Installation of Scrupal is dead simple:
* Download a file and unpack it with unzip.
* Run the included start program
* Point your web browser at localhost:9000
* Answer some questions to complete the installation.
Easy, pleasy. As easy as WordPress .. maybe even easier.

### Cutting Edge Technology
Scrupal was designed as a technology refresh from the outset. While we avoid the bleeding edge (so you don't cut
yourself), we do rapidly adopt the latest proven technologies and we will continue to do so with each major release.
We are always looking for:
* The right tool for the job (replacing older ones as better ones come along)
* New tools to do things we never originally imagined.
* Better ways of developing software to be more responsive to user demand.

### Verity
Verity is a module in Scrupal that provides a user driven system of vouching for the veracity of information put into
a Scrupal web application. The days of free-for-all wiki and forum systems are over. Without some way to keep the
malfeasants, scammers, spammers, and the terminally unkind out of your system, the quality of information that will
get put into it will decline. Any popular site will suffer the signal-to-noise problem simply because of its
popularity. Verity is how we combat that, by asking a system's users to participate collaboratively in vouching and
verifying each others' information.
