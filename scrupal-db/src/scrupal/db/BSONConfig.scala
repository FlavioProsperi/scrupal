/** BSON Object
  * This is a thin wrapper around a BSONDocument that provides much the same API as Play's Configuration class.
  * It does the necessary translations and conversions to pull data out of the BSONDocument in various ways.
  * This just helps bridge the gap between BSON and regular Scala types.
