# About The Name
You might be wondering about how we came up with the name. It had a number of incarnations over a few years but
eventually the idea for Scrupal was: *do what drupal did 15 years ago but make it much better*. The *make it much
better* part has a lot to do with the Scala programming language that is at the essence of Scrupal. So, I'm sure
you've caught on by now: ```SCRUPAL = SCala + dRUPAL```. We also like that it has a pun with the word scruple. Much
of what is done in software is unscrupulous. We intend to change that, both in what we produce and how we produce it.

And, no, sorry to disappoint, but this has nothing to do with screwing your pals!
