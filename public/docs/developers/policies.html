# Development Policies

## Versions

+ Odd numbered minor versions (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, etc.) are unstable development versions.
+ Even numbered minor versions (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, etc.) are tested, stable, released versions.
+ There will be no backporting of fixes to preior release versions before 1.0

## Patch & Pull Request Standards

+ Follow applicable portions of [Play's guidelines](http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Guidelines)
+ No Java code, Scala only.
+ Code review is our first line of quality assurance. Do not be offended if your submission is heavily critiqued.
Instead, learn from the review, or point out where you believe the reviewer may have made a mistake. The point is to
have a conversation about the code until multiple people are happy that the patch is the RightThing(tm)
