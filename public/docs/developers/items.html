# I.T.E.M.S.
This acronym is used in Scrupal as a reminder of the five basic classes that make up the information model, as follows:

+ **I**nstance - An Instance of an Entity
+ **T**ype - A definition of how to validate some unit of information, including bundling it together
+ **E**ntity - The definition of a manipulable entity through the REST API that marries a BundleType with behaviors.
+ **M**odule - A collection of types, entities and other things that serve a common purpose
+ **S**ite - A collection of information containing a set of enabled modules and associated instances.

This simple model is at the heart of making Scrupal extensible. The data typing system is flexible enough to compose
large graphs of objects and Module developers can provide functionality to operate on them without restriction.
