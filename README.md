# Scrupal

Welcome to  Scrupal, an open source platform for building the next generation of web applications. The original
idea for Scrupal was to do what [Drupal](https://drupal.org) did a decade ago: create a platform on which web
applications could be constructed without doing much or even any coding. Furthermore, it needed to be scalable and
so the name was derived by combining `Scalable` with `Drupal`. However, Scrupal and Drupal have nothing in common
except the common goal of making it simple to build rich and useful web applications. Today, Scrupal aims to be the
foundation of the next generation of web applications with the following goals:
* **S**calable - Scrupal uses Scala, Play and Akka as the basis of a scalable framework that runs anywhere.
* **C**omprehensive - Scrupal is opinionated as it integrates the best modern web technologies and will continue to utilize the best as new technologies develop.
* **R**eactive - Scrupal supports the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) by focusing on events, scale, resiliency, and responsiveness.
* **U**niform - Scrupal's uniform design at the right level of abstraction make large scale applications understandable without sacrificing customization or extensibility.
* **P**roductive - Scrupal aims to be a highly productive tool for developers, users and operators of web systems because it applies [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) throughout.
* **A**pplication - Scrupal is application-oriented-software. It is not suited for systems programming but very adept at enterprise, mobile, and large scale applications.
* **L**amina - Scrupal is a lamina that hides the complexities of integrating a suite of other technologies: Scala, Play, Akka, Specs2, Slick, Redis, SQL, AngularJS, Grunt, Karma, Bootstrap, HTML5, REST, etc.

Scrupal has scruples. It is built on a set of principles honed from decades of software development experience. For
more details, please read [the documentation](http://scrupal.org/docs).
