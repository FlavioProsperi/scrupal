# Scrupal

Welcome to Scrupal, a content management system and web application platform. Scrupal aims to provide similar
functionality as [Drupal](https://drupal.org) did a decade ago: the ability to construct modular, content focused
web applications without doing much or even any coding. However, the similarity ends there. Scrupal is based on
scalable and reactive technologies and aims to handle even the most challenging applications.

## Current Status

Although Scrupal has been under development for several years, it has undergone several refactoring stages to align
with other technologies better. At this point, July 2015, many of the technical decisions on the architecture have
been decided and work is resuming on making it stable and functional again. It is expected by the end of 2015 that
Scrupal may be nearing its initial releases that would be production worthy.

## Quick Start

Right now there isn't much of a quick start to Scrupal. You will need to understand the software in order to use it.
This will change in subsequent releases. For now, you can launch the Welcome Site, review the documentation and try
the Echo Entity by running the main scrupal module.

## Technologies
Scrupal is opinionated as it integrates the best modern web technologies and will continue to utilize the best as
new technologies develop. Some of the technologies Scrupal utilizes are:

- [JVM 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/documentation/8u-relnotes-2225394.html) - Version 8 of the Java Virtual Machine
