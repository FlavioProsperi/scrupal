## Introduction
Welcome to  Scrupal, an open source platform for building the next generation of web applications. The original
idea for Scrupal was to do what [Drupal](https://drupal.org) did a decade ago: create a platform on which web
applications could be constructed without doing much or even any coding. Furthermore, it needed to be scalable and
so the name was derived by combining `Scalable` with `Drupal`. However, Scrupal and Drupal have nothing in common
except the common goal of making it simple to build rich and useful web sites.

## Mnemonic Name
Scrupal's name is a mnemonic for its goals. Scrupal aims to be the foundation of the next generation of web
applications with the following goals:

- Scalable - Scrupal uses a [reactive](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) platform as the basis of a scalable framework that runs on the JVM.

- Comprehensive - Through a modular approach to extensibility Scrupal

- Reactive - Scrupal supports the [Reactive Manifesto](http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/) by focusing on events, scale, resiliency, and responsiveness.

- Uniform - Scrupal's uniform design at the right level of abstraction make large scale applications understandable without sacrificing customization or extensibility.

- Productive - Scrupal aims to be a highly productive tool for developers, users and operators of web systems because it applies [DRY](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself) throughout.

- Application - Scrupal is application-oriented-software. It is not suited for systems programming but very adept at enterprise, mobile, and large scale web applications.

- Layer - Scrupal is a software layer that hides the complexities of integrating a suite of other technologies:

Scrupal has scruples. It is built on a set of principles honed from decades of software development experience.
For more details, please read [the documentation](http://scrupal.org/docs).

## Technologies
Scrupal is opinionated as it integrates the best modern web technologies and will continue to utilize the best as
new technologies develop. Some of the technologies Scrupal utilizes are:

- [Scala](http://scala-lang.org/) - A hybrid functional object-oriented language.

- [Akka](http://akka.io/) - An actor system executor for reactive distributed systems.

- [Spray](http://spray.io/) - An efficient HTTP request/response router and processor

- [Scalatags](https://github.com/lihaoyi/scalatags) - A templating system integrated with Scala

- [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) - A NoSQL Database

- ReactiveMongo - An asynchronous non-blocking database driver for MongoDB

- Redis - A best-of-breed caching system

- Twitter Bootstrap - The standard for modern HTML5 web site construction

- AngularJS - The framework chosen for delivering One Page Applications

- Specs2 - BDD style testing

- marked - Efficient markdown processor

## Status

Scrupal is nowhere near ready for prime time. Although it has been in development for several years, there has ben only
one developer working on it until 2015 and it has undergone several machinations to arrive at its current form. It is
patterned after the spray and akka projects in terms of its structure.
