# scrupal

Welcome to  Scrupal, an open source platform for building interesting community based web applications. The original
idea for this software was to do what [Drupal](https://drupal.org) did a decade ago: create a platform on
which web sites could be constructed without doing much or even any coding. However, its goals have far exceeded its
humble origins. Scrupal now differs from Drupal in the following ways:
* Scrupal is a technology refresh: Scala, Play, Akka, MongoDB, Angular.js, bootstrap, REST api, asynchronous, etc.
* Scrupal has scruples - it is built on a set of principles honed from 35 years of software development experience
* Scrupal is social - built for the most demanding social networking applications
* Scrupal is mobile - responsive design to support any mobile platform
* The only thing Scrupal and Drupal share is the desire to simplify web application construction.

There are many more ways to explore Scrupal, each with their own documentation page. You can find out more at these
locations:
* [Audience](docs/audience.md) - Who should use Scrupal and why
* [Getting Started](docs/getting_started.md) - How to get up and running with Scrupal quickly.
* [Features](docs/features.md) - A description of Scrupal's more interesting features
* [Scruples](docs/scruples.md) - The scruples we use on this software project
* [Technology](docs/technology.md) - A look at the technology Scrupal is based on .. and why.
* [Tutorials](docs/tutorials.md) - Step-by-step walkthroughs (using Scrupal of course!) to show you how to do a
variety of interesting things with Scrupal
* [License](LICENSE) - Our GPL v3 open source license

Finally, just in case there was any doubt, Scrupal is not about screwing your pals. It's name was derived by
combining `Scala` with `Drupal` with the obvious pun on scruple.
