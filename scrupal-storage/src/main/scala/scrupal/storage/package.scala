/** Abstract Storage Model For Scrupal Data
  *
  * Scrupal provides a very simple storage model that can be implemented via databases, flat files, memory caches, etc.
  * This package contains the api for accessing these data sources in a generic fashion as well as the
  * implementation of various simple storage systems. Users may provide their own implementations based on other data
  * storage mechanisms. The model imposes few constraints on the underlying storage system. It makes some assumptions
  * about the structure of the information that must be maintained by the concrete implementation. Those assumptions
  * are:
  * - A given type of storage system is represented by the [[scrupal.storage.api.StorageContext]] class
  * - A StorageContext allows [[scrupal.storage.api.Store]] objects to be opened and closed.
  * - The [[scrupal.storage.api.Store]] objects contain named [[scrupal.storage.api.Schema]] instances.
  * - The [[scrupal.storage.api.Schema]] objects contain named [[scrupal.storage.api.Collection]] instances.
  * - The [[scrupal.storage.api.Collection]] objects contain indices to arbitrary objects.
  * - Collections are groups of related objects; related by purpose, not structure or content.
  * - Collections must have one primary index that uses the document's identifier type.
  * - Collections may have additional keys or even multi-field keys based on named fields in the objects.
  * - Documents without an optional key simply don't get put in that index (but will still be in the primary index)
  * - Serialization is done with Scala Pickling to/from either binary or string (JSON) formats.
  * - Management of the storage is beyond the scope of Scrupal. This is only a data manipulation interface
