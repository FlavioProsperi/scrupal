# Standing On The Shoulders Of Giants
Scrupal would not be possible without the free/libre/open source software community. Any recognition it
achieves clearly needs to acknowledge the technologies upon which it is built, and the dedication and brilliance
of their inventors. This page is all about giving such recognition and making sure we honor their software license
agreement through inclusion of their licenses here.

<h3>The Java Virtual Machine and Java Programming Language</h3>
<p>Scrupal runs on top of the long trusted, production competent Java Virtual Machine. Running application software
this way has made sense for numerous organizations and will continue to do so for many years to come. The depth of
resources, wealth of libraries, and deployment flexibility in the JVM eco-system bring levels of competence and
capability Scrupal could not achieve otherwise. Because Scrupal does not re-distribute the JVM, we do not have a
license restriction. However, if you plan to use the "Commerical Features" provided by the JVM via Scrupal then you
should be aware of this clause of the Oracle BCL:</p>
<pre>
Use of the Commercial Features for any commercial or production purpose requires a separate license from Oracle.
“Commercial Features” means those features identified Table 1-1 (Commercial Features In Java SE Product Editions) of
the Java SE documentation accessible at

<h3>Scala Programming Language</h3>
<p>Almost all of Scrupal is written in Scala. The initial letters of Scrupal's name are attributed to Scala or at least
it aims to have the same concern: scalability. We tip our hats to all those who have made Scala into such a beautiful
language to work with. The Scala Programming Language requires the following copyright notices to be reproduced:</p>
