# Entity REST API Auto-Documentation
Scrupal entities provide a REST API to allow interaction with them. Understanding this API is a large part of learning
how to use the entities so Scrupal provides an automatically generated documentation site for all accessible entities.
The documentation is generated via introspection on the Entity subclasses and with cooperation of those subclasses to
provide written documentation for each operation.

More details TBD
