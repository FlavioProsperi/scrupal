# Scrupal API Project

The scrupal-api project is where all the essential classes and traits for Scrupal are defined. It is also where the
processing engine of Scrupal resides. The core abstractions in Scrupal form an acronym, MANIFESTO, which stands for:

- **[M: Module](module.md):** A container of functionality that defines the other types of api objects.

- **[A: Action](action.md):** A URL context and a set of enabled modules, entities and nodes

- **[N: Node](node.md):** A content generation function

- **[I: Instance](instance.md):** An instance of an entity (essentially a document)

- **[F: Facet](facet.md):** Something to add on to an instance's main payload

- **[E: Entity](entity.md):** A type of instance with definitions for the actions that can be performed on it

- **[S: Site](site.md):** Site management data and a set of applications enabled for it.

- **[T: Type](type.md):** A fundamental data type used for validating BSONValues (Instances and Node results)

- **[O: Others](others.md):** Other objects of lesser importance and reserved for future use.
