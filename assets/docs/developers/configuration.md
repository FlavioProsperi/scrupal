# Configuration
Scrupal uses the Typesafe Config library for its configuration. There are multiple ways to manage the configuration:
+ Specify options on the command line as java system properties.
+ Place options in a configuration file and use a java system property to tell Scrupal where it is.
+ Once running, use the administration system to manage configuration files.
