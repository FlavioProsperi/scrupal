/** An Echoing Application
  * Almost the simplest of applications to construct this is mostly a test of the fundamentals but may have some
  * utility as heartbeat between servers. This application servers one entity, an echo entity, which takes in
  * requests, formats them into HTML and responds with the content. When you go to the app you see the GET
  * request for the page you requested as the response. It has one special page which allows you to submit a
  * form. Query args are returned if you provide them on the web page. This could also be used for benchmarking.
