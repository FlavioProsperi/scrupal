/** Documentation Application For Marked
  *
  * This application allows packaged documentation formatted in marked (like markdown) notation to be presented
  * within a context. This allows module vendors or site owners to easily maintain documentation in plain marked
  * format and have it added easily to their site. Since the marked documents need no processing, they should be
  * placed somewhere under the "public" directory in your module. All this application needs is a name and a
  * relative path to the top level directory of your documentation and it will do the rest.
