/** Simple Reverse Routing For Scrupal
  *
  * Reverse Routing is the process of generating a URI path for a certain resource. In Scrupal, paths are not arbitrary
  * but highly structured and regular. Because of this regularity, the corresponding path can be constructed quite
  * easily especially from a given context. Every operation in Scrupal has a context in which that operation occurs.
  * The context provides the site, application, request context, and other details of the operation that is
  * requesting a reverse route. Because the context is present, the reverse route can be generated easily by simply
  * substituting context and requested elements.
  *
  * Each controller must provide the ReverseRoute objects that it serves. These ReverseRoute objects are really
  * just patterns for constructing the path. When needed,
