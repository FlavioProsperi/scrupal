/** Generate content With an operating system command

  * This will invoke a local operating system command to generate content. As this forks the VM it should be
  * restricted to administrative users. However, for those cases where python, bash, perl or a simple grep/awk/sed
  * pipeline is the best thing, this is the tool to use. It simply passes the string to the local operating system's
  * command processor for interpretation and execution. Whatever it generates is Streamed as a result to this node.

  * @param description A description of the results produced by this command node
