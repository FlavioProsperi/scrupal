/** Scrupal Programming Interface
  * Welcome to programming with Scrupal. This is the top level package for all Scrupal software. Scrupal uses a flat
  * three level hierarchy: `scrupal.{package}.{file}`. There should be no software files at this level,
  * it is just a container of other packages and possibly a few global definitions in this package object.
