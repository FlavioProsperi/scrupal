@(what: String, why: String)(implicit context : scrupal.controllers.Context)

@import scrupal.views.html

@html.markedPage("Not Found - " + what) {

# Nuh Uh! I Can't Do That!
**Drat!** Because @why, you can't @what. That's just the way it is.

I suggest you try one of these options:

+ Type in another URL, or
+ try to get lucky with [this suggestion](@context.suggestURL).

}
