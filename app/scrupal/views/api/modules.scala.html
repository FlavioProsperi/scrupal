#  Welcome To Scrupal API Documentation
Since you're reading this, you must have used the ```/doc/api``` URL in your browser. Congratulations,
you've learned how to access the API documentation for SCRUPAL. Essentially, all you need to do is put "/doc" in
front of the API call that you want to know about and you will get information about that call.
